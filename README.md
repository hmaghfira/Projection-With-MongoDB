# Projection With MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database which stores the data in form of key-value pairs. In mongoDB, projection means selecting only the necessary data rather than selecting whole of the data of a document. If a document has 5 fields and you need to show only 3, then select only 3 fields from them.<br>

The goal of this repository is creating new collection from existing collection (called projection). The detail steps can be seen on [ipynb file](https://github.com/hmaghfira/Projection-With-MongoDB/blob/master/Practice%201%20-%20Hania%20Maghfira.ipynb).

# Getting Started
This repository guides "How to create collection from exist collection". Tools that used in this case are :
1. Jupyter Notebook.
2. MongoDB Compass (GUI to access mongoDB) [download here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass).
3. PyMongo (way to work with MongoDB from Python, dependencies was already written on ipynb file).
3. Internet connection (except Telkomsel product. I dunno why it didn't work if use Telkomsel hehe).
